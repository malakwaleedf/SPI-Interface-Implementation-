Developed an SPI slave interface integrated with single-port RAM using FSM design in Verilog. 
Verified design functionality using QuestaSim for testbench simulation and waveform analysis. 
Synthesized the design on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA using Vivado and evaluated different state encodings to achieve optimal timing performance.
